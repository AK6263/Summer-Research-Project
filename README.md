# Summer-Research-Project

The final report of my reading project that I completed under the supervision of Prof. Jayasri Das Sarma (Dept. Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata). The project title was "SARS-CoV-2 and its parallels with m-CoV". In this project I studied the parallels between m-CoV and SARS-CoV 2 and how m-CoV is used as a suitable candidate as a model for studing SARS-CoV-2 in mice.
